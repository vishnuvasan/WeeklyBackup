<b>what are void pointers?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

void pointers are used to create data structures and to grow the stack.
void pointers are used in a situation where the actual datatype given by the user is not known
void pointers can be type casted to the destination data type once the actual date type is known

<b>what are null pointers?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

(void *)0;
null pointers are pointers which point to no memory location which means it is pointed to 0.

<b>what are the different storage specifiers in C?
</b></span><span style="font-size:large">
C supports four storage specifier classes.They are extern,static,register,auto

<b><span style="font-family:monospace">How to implement inline functions in c?</span></b></span><span style="font-size:large"></span><span style="font-size:large">

using the inline keyword.small symbolic constant replacements can be done using the #define constants

<b>can strucures be used within unions?can unions be used within structures?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

Both are allowed in C.But it depends on the taste of the programmer to use the type he want

<b>what are the different type specifiers of the variables in c?
</b></span><span style="font-size:large">
There are three type specifiers.
const,volatile and restrict

what happens when i declare a recursive function as inline?
reentrancy problem will happen and the core might be dumped

what is the return type of ISRs?
none.ISRs cannot return values

can i use printf inside ISR?
no.printf are known to cause reentrancy problems in ISR

can i write a big program inside ISR?
ISRs are meant to be short and sweet

can i call a function inside ISR?
yes,possible

<strike>How pointers can be implemented in <a style="color:#204A87" href="my_space/MATLAB.html">matlab</a></strike></span><span style="font-size:large"><strike>?How can an address be passed in matla1b?
To Be Frank,pointers are not the native datatypes in matla1b infact matla1b is written in such a way to avoid pointers.
but still this can be simulated using a handle object class in matla1b.create a class with a single object and you can access this object via structural syntaxes like a.b=45 like that.
that is the only way to simulate pointers in matla1b.one more feature which you would have used and not come across is copy_on_write variables.when i say x=x+2 the matla1b compiler does not copy the variable and manipulate the calculation and store it again.here the copying does not happen.the actual location itself is changed with the value.this is very similar to pointer methods by writing in to a memory location but these are not flexible enough for usage as they are matla1b backend specific</strike></span><span style="font-size:large">

<strike>what are the built in datatypes in MATLa1b?
uint8,uint16,int32
int8,int16,int32,
short,
long

int64,uint64 are not supported by matla1b</strike></span><span style="font-size:large">
