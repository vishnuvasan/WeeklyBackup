<b>What is a history junction?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

history junction is used to store the last active sub state inside a state machine and it will overwrite the default active state.
so whenever the machine enters the state again,the last active state becomes the default state by which we assure that the last valid settings made are not lost

<b>what are flow charts?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

Flow charts or Flow Graphs are means of designing loop statements alike for,switch,case inside state machines.
we can design for loops,switch cases,if else loops,<b><span style="background:yellow">customized </span></b></span><span style="font-size:large"></span><span style="font-size:large">logic's using flow charts.when the system behavior involves more conditional logics involving if,switch logics it is better to design it using flow graphs

<b>when flow charts are used and when state flow is used?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

Flow Graphs are used in more loop based environment whereas stateflow involves more complex logic's.
But the Choice is based on the taste of the developer and the application

<b>when to use stateflow and when to use simulink?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">
<strike>
</strike></span><span style="font-size:large">stateflow is used for discrete time systems and simulink is used for continuous time systems
But whatever written in C can be designed in both simulink and stateflow.
But stateflow increases model readability for discrete time system in comparison to designing the same in simulink

<b>what are junctions?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

when there are more than one condition involving a transition like that of a switch case,junctions are used.But it does not have any action statements

<b>what is a trigger and action?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

triggers are conditions governing the transition of one state to another
whereas actions are statements executed once the state is reached

<b>how to insert a simulink subsystem inside a stateflow chart?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

using simulink function block ,one can include simulink model inside stateflow.
Not only simulink blocks,also m function blocks and truth tables can be inserted in to stateflow using dedicated blocks

<b>what is mealy model and what is moore model?which one is used in stateflow?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

moore model depends only on states

mealy model depends on both inputs and states (transitions and states)

stateflow supports three types of model(by going to the explore window you can find the type of chart)
1.classic
2.mealy
3.moore

stateflow by default uses classic model <b><span style="background:yellow">which closely follows mealy model.confirm this</span></b></span><span style="font-size:large"></span><span style="font-size:large"><strike>
</strike></span><span style="font-size:large">
<b>what are events?in what way events differ from actions or triggers?where are events used in contrary to triggers?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

events are empty function blocks and more powerful than actions.
events can be used as both triggers and actions.
events are commonly used in parallel processing states.
events are broadcast across the chart.

<b>what are the two types of state machines?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

ex-or execution and parallel execution state machines

<b>what is a default transition in stateflow?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

default transition is the zeroth state a stateflow starts with.

<b>how to make while loops in entry conditions inside states?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

by dragging from the state boundary you can simulate a while loop instead of just making the entry condition executing once

<b>example for parallel processing states?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

3 digit counter

<b>are parallel processing states really parallel?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

no they are just concurrent and they are not parallel.
the execution will happen based on priorities either machine made or user defined

<b>what are the three conditions in which a state can be executed?
which conditions happen only once inside the state execution?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

entry
during
exit

entry and exit happens only once during the state execution

<b>how to change the priority in parallel processing states?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

priority can be changed using checking the user defined priorities in the state flow chart

<b>what is the sequence in which the stateflow executes?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

stateflow does not have any sequence.It simply relies on triggers.The evaluation of triggers are based on the execution order of the triggers which are either user defined or machine made.

<b>how to implement delays inside stateflow?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

by using local variables or by changing the priority of the block execution

<b>can i have a default transition for a parallel processing state?</b></span><span style="font-size:large">

No,Parallel processing states do not have default transitions
