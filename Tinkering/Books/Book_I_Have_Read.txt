2. Anna Karenina - Leo Tolstoy - 30th December 2018 - Ok Ok Kind

	This book is very very detailed interms of the scene,the specifics and characters. Really a masterpiece.
	But one need lot of patience to read it. I loved the Character Levin. I would not say i was impressed by Anna Karenina.
	But the Character of Levin was awesome and I could see a me in Him. 
	This book has literally travelled with me for miles. I took it to germany, then to bangalore, then to home town and then to assam.
	And when i completed reading this book i was actually in a flight from guwahati. :)
	I have literally read this book in all the flight journeys.Something is there in this book but.
	Very Philosophical equally.I like the character of levin minus all the boring chapters.
